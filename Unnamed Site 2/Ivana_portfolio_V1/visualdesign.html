<p> <h4> The first image is about a mosue and cheese this project was to make art with everyday object. In the picture I drew a mouse and used real cheese.The second image is a snow-woman since it was the christmas season. To make this snow-woman you will need a long sock, rice, a ribbon and markers,(the bow was an extra decorations). The 3rd image is basically a recreation of an album cover. The album I chose to recreate was Nicki Minaj's "Queen" album because it's my favorite album from her.The last image is Manja characters. In this assignment I had to create manja characters and create a storyline. The manja story is about a boy was at the park and wanted to play with some other boys, but they said No. the boy was sad. Another boy who witnessed the issue went up to the crying boy and ask to play with him instead, so he did, they were all happy. The End! </h4> </p>
