	<p> The last image is Manja characters. In this assignment I had to create manja characters and create a storyline. The manja story is about a boy was at the park and wanted to play with some other boys, but they said No. the boy was sad. Another boy who witnessed the issue went up to the crying boy and ask to play with him instead, so he did, they were all happy. The End!  </p>
