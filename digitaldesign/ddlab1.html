  <h1> Gotta Go Hard</h1>
	<h2> Nicki Minaj </h2>

<p>I think it's my time
You know why? My tears have dried <br> 
And I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper <br>
(We make it look easy) <br>
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators <br>
Young Money (Holiday Season) <br>
If you could you would get rid of me
what you gon' do when I try to go hard?<br> But I won't let you get to me (to me) <br>
You should already figure I'ma go hard <br>
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne <br>
I done put the chokehold
Now they screamin, "Nicki leave me alone.</p> </br>

  <h1> All Things Go </h1>
  <h2> Nicki Minaj </h2>
<p> I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone <br>
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for <br>
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong <br>
'Cause I'ma ride out with you still the night is young <br>
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go <br> 
We wake back up and do it all again <br> 
(And we know, we know) say forget the world, we ridin' until the end <br>
When all is said and done, look what we've become <br>
I just want you to know that I did it for you. 
</p> </br>
